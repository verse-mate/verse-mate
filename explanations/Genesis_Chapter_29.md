In the broader context, this chapter signifies a crucial phase in Jacob's journey, following his flight from his brother Esau and his divine encounter at Bethel (Genesis 28).

### Passage Analysis

#### “Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east. And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. And the stone upon the well's mouth was great.”

**Analysis:**
- **Setting and Symbolism of the Well:**
  - The well is an important symbol representing life and sustenance in the arid regions of the Near East.
  - Notably, similar encounters at wells involving Abraham's servant finding Rebekah (Genesis 24) parallel Jacob’s meeting Rachel here, suggesting a divine ordinance and continuity in the familial lineage.

#### “And thither were all the flocks gathered. And they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place. And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran are we. And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well. And, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.”

**Analysis:**
- **Community and Custom:**
  - The collective effort to remove the stone indicates a communal lifestyle where tasks are shared.
  - Jacob’s inquiry about Laban shows his immediate intent to establish a connection with his extended family, signifying the importance of kinship ties.

#### “And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water ye the sheep, and go and feed them. And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep.”

**Analysis:**
- **Jacob’s Leadership:**

And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father.”

**Analysis:**

  - This introduces the theme of labor for marriage, which becomes a central element of this narrative.

#### **"And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. And Leah's eyes were tender. But Rachel was beautiful and well favored. And Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel. And they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her."**

**Analysis:**
- **Contrast Between Leah and Rachel:**
  - This establishes Rachel’s favored status due to her beauty, setting up a future conflict with Leah.
  - Jacob’s love for Rachel drives him to willingly labor for seven years, emphasizing the depth of his affection and patience.

#### **"And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. And he went in unto her. And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid. And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born. Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid. And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb. But Rachel was barren. And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben. For she said, Because Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction. For now my husband will love me. And she conceived again, and bare a son: and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I am hated, he hath therefore given me this `son' also. And she called his name Simeon. And she conceived again, and bare a son. And said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore was his name called Levi. And she conceived again, and bare a son. And she said, This time will I praise Jehovah. Therefore she called his name Judah. And she left off bearing."**

**Analysis:**
- **Deception and Repercussions:**
  - Laban’s deceit in substituting Leah for Rachel underscores the theme of trickery and its consequences.
