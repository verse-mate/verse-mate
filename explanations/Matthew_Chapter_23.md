- **Moses' Seat:** This refers to the position of authority that the scribes and Pharisees claim concerning teaching the Law of Moses.
- **Authority and Respect:** Jesus acknowledges their authoritative position but sets the stage for criticizing their behavior.

#### All things therefore whatsoever they bid you, `these' do and observe: but do not ye after their works; for they say, and do not.

**Analysis:**
- **Do as They Say, Not as They Do:** Jesus instructs the people to follow the teachings of the Law but cautions against mimicking the hypocritical behavior of the Pharisees.
- **Hypocrisy:** The leaders are guilty of instructing others to follow religious laws which they themselves do not keep, highlighting their insincerity.

#### Yea, they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger.

**Analysis:**
- **Burdensome Laws:** The Pharisees impose strict and heavy religious laws on people, adding to their burdens without offering help or leniency.
- **Lack of Compassion:** Their failure to assist or empathize with the struggles of ordinary people underscores their lack of true leadership.
