### Passage Analysis

#### 1. "Now late on the sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first `day' of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre."

**Analysis:**
- **Timing of Events:** The mention of "late on the sabbath" highlights that these events occur on Sunday, the first day of the week, a significant day for Christians as it marks the resurrection of Jesus. This sets the stage for the transformation of worship from the traditional Jewish Sabbath (Saturday) to Sunday in Christian practice.
- **Role of Women:** Mary Magdalene and "the other Mary" (likely Mary the mother of James and Joseph) play crucial roles as eyewitnesses to the resurrection, emphasizing the importance and inclusion of women in Jesus' ministry.

#### 2. "And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it."

#### 11. "Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass. 12. And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers, 13. saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. 14. And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care. 15. So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, `and continueth' until this day."

**Analysis:**
- **Conspiracy and Deception:** This section reveals the lengths to which the religious leaders went to suppress the truth of the resurrection. The bribery of the guards indicates a deliberate attempt to counteract the emerging Christian testimony.

Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: 20. teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world."
