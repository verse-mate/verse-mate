### Passage Analysis

#### "In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."

**Key Themes:**

- **Humility and Childlike Faith:**
  - Jesus uses a child as an example of the humility required to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
  - This gesture underscores the need for purity, innocence, and dependence on God, much like a child's dependence on their parents.

- **Turning and Becoming as Little Children:**
  - The term "turn" suggests a need for repentance and transformation.
  - The instruction to become like children points not to immaturity, but to the qualities of humility, trust, and simplicity.

#### "Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."

**Key Insights:**

- **Greatness Redefined:**
  - The notion of greatness in God's Kingdom is radically different from worldly views.
  - True greatness involves humility and a willingness to serve others.

- **Humility as Service:**
  - Jesus emphasizes that greatness is not about status or achievements but about one's heart and attitude towards others.

#### "And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me:"

**Theological Implications:**

- **Receiving Others in Jesus' Name:**
  - To welcome and care for those who are humble and dependent, as symbolized by children, is to welcome Jesus Himself.
  - This teaching reinforces the importance of hospitality and kindness within the Christian community.

#### "But whoso shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck, and `that' he should be sunk in the depth of the sea."

**Moral Responsibility:**

- **Consequences of Leading Others Astray:**
  - Jesus gives a stern warning about the severe consequences of causing others, especially those who are young in faith or vulnerable, to sin.
  - The imagery of a millstone and sea emphasizes the gravity of such actions.

#### "Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling! for it must needs be that the occasions come; but woe to that man through whom the occasion cometh!"

**Broader Themes:**

- **Inevitability and Accountability:**
  - While stumbling blocks (temptations or situations leading to sin) are inevitable in a fallen world, Jesus warns those who become the source of such stumbling.
  - The dual lamentation ("woe") articulates sorrow for the existence of sin and condemnation for those who propagate it.

#### "And if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed or halt, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire."

**Radical Discipleship:**

- **Drastic Measures Against Sin:**
  - Jesus uses hyperbolic language to stress the importance of dealing decisively with sin.
  - The imagery of cutting off a hand or foot underscores the need for radical action to avoid sin and its consequences.

- **Eternal Perspective:**
  - The mention of "eternal fire" emphasizes the seriousness of sin and the eternal ramifications of unchecked sinful behavior.

#### "See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven."

**Angelic Watchfulness:**

- **Value of the Humble:**
  - Even the seemingly insignificant (metaphorically the 'little ones') are highly valued in God's Kingdom.
  - Jesus assures that angels are continuously watching over them, highlighting their worth and God's protective care.

#### "For the Son of man came to save that which was lost."

**Mission of Jesus:**

- **Redemptive Purpose:**
  - Jesus clearly states His mission is to seek and save the lost, aligning His actions with God's merciful and restorative nature.
  - This underpins the subsequent parable of the lost sheep.

#### "How think ye? if any man have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and go unto the mountains, and seek that which goeth astray? And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray."

**Joy for the Lost Found:**

- **God's Persistent Love:**
  - The parable illustrates God's relentless pursuit of every individual, especially the wayward.
  - The joy of finding the lost sheep highlights the immense value placed on each person.

#### "Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish."

**God's Will:**

- **Universal Redemptive Desire:**
  - It is God’s desire that everyone is saved and none are lost, affirming the lengths God goes to recover the lost.

#### "And if thy brother sin against thee, go, show him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother."

**Conflict Resolution:**

- **Private Reconciliation:**
  - Jesus instructs believers on resolving conflicts privately and personally first, emphasizing restoration over judgment.

#### "But if he hear `thee' not, take with thee one or two more, that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may be established."

**Structured Approach:**

- **Escalation System:**
  - If private reconciliation fails, a structured approach involving witnesses ensures serious and fair mediation.

#### "And if he refuse to hear them, tell it unto the church: and if he refuse to hear the church also, let him be unto thee as the Gentile and the publican."

**Community and Accountability:**

- **Community Discipline:**
  - The matter is brought before the church as a last resort, reflecting communal responsibility and accountability.
  - Treating them as "Gentile and publican" reflects disassociation due to unrepentance, yet not devoid of love or hope for future reconciliation.

#### "Verily I say unto you, what things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."

**Spiritual Authority:**

- **Heaven and Earth Connection:**
  - Jesus’ statement underscores the spiritual authority granted to His followers, linking earthly actions with eternal consequences.

#### "Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father who is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them."

**Power of Agreement:**

- **Collective Prayer:**
  - The significance of unity and collective prayer is highlighted, promising God's presence and intervention.

#### "Then came Peter and said to him, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven."

**Boundless Forgiveness:**

- **Peter’s Question on Forgiveness:**
  - Jesus expands the concept of forgiveness beyond traditional limits, advocating for continual, unlimited forgiveness.

#### "Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, who would make a reckoning with his servants."

**King and Servant Parable:**

- **Debt and Forgiveness:**
  - The parable contrasts the immense mercy of the king with the servant’s unforgiving nature, illustrating God’s expectation for us to forgive as we have been forgiven.
