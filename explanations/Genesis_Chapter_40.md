### Introduction

Genesis Chapter 40 is an integral part of the larger narrative of Joseph's life, a key figure in the Book of Genesis. Joseph, the favored son of Jacob, is sold into slavery by his jealous brothers and ends up in Egypt serving Potiphar, an official of Pharaoh. Despite his unfair treatment and eventual imprisonment due to false accusations, God's presence with Joseph is evident throughout his trials. This chapter focuses on Joseph's interactions with two of Pharaoh's key officers during his time in prison and highlights his extraordinary gift of dream interpretation, which would later play a significant role in his rise to power in Egypt.
