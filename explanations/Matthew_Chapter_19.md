### Passage Analysis

#### And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judaea beyond the Jordan; and great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.

**Context and Significance:**
- **Geography:** Jesus moves from Galilee to Judea, marking a geographical shift that signifies His journey toward Jerusalem and the culmination of His earthly ministry.

#### And there came unto him Pharisees, trying him, and saying, Is it lawful `for a man' to put away his wife for every cause?

**Confrontation with Pharisees:**
- **Pharisees' Test:** The Pharisees attempt to trap Jesus with a divisive question about divorce, reflecting frequent legal and ethical debates of the time.
- **Cultural Background:** Divorce was a contentious issue in Jewish law, governed by different interpretations of Moses' commandments.

#### And he answered and said, Have ye not read, that he who made `them' from the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?

**Jesus’ Response:**
- **Biblical Foundations:** Jesus references Genesis, emphasizing the original divine intention for marriage – unity and permanence.
- **Creation Order:** He underscores God's design in creating male and female, and the sacred union of marriage.

#### So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

**Theological Implications:**
- **Indissolubility of Marriage:** Jesus reiterates that marriage is a God-ordained covenant, stressing its sanctity and permanence.
- **Human Intervention:** He warns against human interference in this divine union.

#### They say unto him, Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorcement, and to put `her' away?

**Challenge by Pharisees:**
- **Mosaic Law Reference:** Pharisees cite Deuteronomy 24:1, questioning Jesus on the legal provision for divorce.

#### He saith unto them, Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it hath not been so.

**Jesus' Clarification:**
- **Concession to Human Weakness:** Jesus explains that Moses’ allowance for divorce was a concession to human hard-heartedness, not reflective of God’s ideal.
- **Return to Divine Ideal:** Jesus calls for a return to the original design of marital fidelity.

#### And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her when she is put away committeth adultery.

**Jesus' Teaching on Divorce:**
- **Adultery Exception:** Jesus permits divorce only in cases of sexual immorality, highlighting the gravity He places on marital vows.
- **Adultery in Remarriage:** Remarrying after divorce, except for this reason, constitutes adultery.

#### The disciples say unto him, If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.

**Disciples' Reaction:**
- **Shock and Realization:** The disciples express astonishment, realizing the stringent nature of Jesus’ teaching on marriage.

#### But he said unto them, Not all men can receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs, that were so born from their mother's womb: and there are eunuchs, that were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.

**Teaching on Celibacy:**
- **Gift of Celibacy:** Jesus acknowledges that celibacy is a special calling, suitable for those who can accept it.
- **Types of Eunuchs:** He identifies three types – born, made, and self-made for the kingdom, indicating diverse paths of dedication.

#### Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should lay his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.

**Children and the Kingdom:**
- **Children's Value:** Jesus emphasizes the importance of children, contradicting the disciples’ rebuke.
- **Inclusivity:** This act demonstrates the inclusivity of God’s kingdom.

#### But Jesus said, Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven. And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.

**Blessing Children:**
- **Invitation and Blessing:** Jesus invites and blesses the children, symbolizing purity and humility as qualities of kingdom people.

#### And behold, one came to him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

**Rich Young Man's Inquiry:**
- **Quest for Eternal Life:** A rich young man’s question opens a discussion on the requirements for eternal life.

#### And he said unto him, Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good: but if thou wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments.

**Jesus’ Response:**
- **Moral Goodness:** Jesus redirects the man’s focus from specific acts to understanding God’s inherent goodness.
- **Commandments:** He points to the adherence to commandments as essential for entering eternal life.

#### He saith unto him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honor thy father and mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.

**Clarification of Commandments:**
- **Specific Commandments:** Jesus enumerates specific commandments, highlighting fundamental moral laws.

#### The young man saith unto him, All these things have I observed: what lack I yet?

**Young Man's Claim:**
- **Claim of Righteousness:** The young man professes adherence to the commandments but feels something is missing.

**Radical Call to Discipleship:**
- **Total Commitment:** Jesus challenges him to go beyond rule-keeping to radical generosity and discipleship.
- **Treasure in Heaven:** Jesus promises eternal rewards for sacrificial giving.

#### But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sorrowful; for he was one that had great possessions.

**Rich Young Man's Response:**
- **Sorrowful Departure:** The young man’s sorrow reflects the difficulty of forsaking wealth for eternal life.

#### And Jesus said unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.

**Teaching on Wealth:**
- **Challenge of Wealth:** Jesus highlights the spiritual peril that wealth poses, making entry into the kingdom difficult.

#### And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

**Graphic Illustration:**
- **Metaphorical Hyperbole:** The camel and needle’s eye metaphor dramatically illustrates the near impossibility for the rich to enter God’s kingdom without divine intervention.

#### And when the disciples heard it, they were astonished exceedingly, saying, Who then can be saved?

**Disciples' Astonishment:**
- **Question of Salvation:** The disciples’ amazement leads them to question the feasibility of salvation.

#### And Jesus looking upon `them' said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.

**Divine Enablement:**
- **Possibility with God:** Jesus reassures that what is humanly impossible is possible with God’s intervention.

#### Then answered Peter and said unto him, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee; what then shall we have?

**Peter's Query:**

**Promise of Rewards:**
- **Regeneration and Reward:** Jesus promises them significant roles and rewards in the future reign of God.

- **Hundredfold Return:** Jesus assures that sacrifices made for His sake will be divinely recompensed.
- **Eternal Life:** Ultimate reward is eternal life.

#### But many shall be last `that are' first; and first `that are' last.

**Reversal of Expectations:**
- **Kingdom Reversals:** Jesus concludes with a principle of reversal in God’s kingdom, where worldly status is upended.
