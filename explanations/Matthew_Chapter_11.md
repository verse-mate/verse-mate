### Introduction

Matthew 11 is a key chapter in the Gospel according to Matthew, found in the New Testament of the Bible. This gospel is traditionally attributed to Matthew, one of Jesus' twelve apostles. The chapter is pivotal as it recounts Jesus’ teachings and miracles as well as interactions with John the Baptist’s disciples. Additionally, it includes strong rebukes to unrepentant cities and an invitation to find rest in Jesus. These events occur during Jesus' ministry in Galilee, which illustrates the growing tension between Jesus’ message and the responses from various audiences.

But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you. 23.
