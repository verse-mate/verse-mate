### Passage Analysis

#### Passage: "And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham. And he said, Here am I. And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah. And offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."

**Analysis:**

- **Divine Test:** 
  - This event is framed as a "test" from God, emphasizing that the primary intent is to prove Abraham's faith and obedience.
