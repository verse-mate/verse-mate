### Introduction

Genesis Chapter 12 marks a pivotal moment in the biblical narrative as it introduces Abram (later named Abraham) and God's covenant with him. This chapter begins the story of the Patriarchs, foundational figures in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and outlines a divine promise that has profound theological implications. It transitions from the universal history of Genesis 1-11 to the particular history or the family history of a single man through whom God plans to bless all nations.
