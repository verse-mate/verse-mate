### Passage Analysis

#### 1. "And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart: ..."

##### The Transfiguration (Verses 1-9)

- **Context and Setting:**
  - Peter, James, and John, part of Jesus' inner circle, are taken to a high mountain, separated from the rest of the disciples.
  - Jesus' face shines like the sun, and his garments become dazzlingly white — a manifestation of his divine glory.
  - Moses and Elijah appear, representing the Law and the Prophets, showing Jesus as the fulfillment of both.

- **Key Themes:**
  - **Divine Glory:** The transfiguration reveals Jesus' divine nature, affirming his identity as the Son of God.
  - **Fulfillment of Prophecy:** The presence of Moses and Elijah ties Jesus to the OT prophecies and shows the continuity of God’s plan.
  - **Divine Approval:** The voice from the cloud ("This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.") echoes God’s previous affirmation at Jesus’ baptism, commanding the disciples to listen to him, highlighting the importance of Jesus' teachings.

- **Theological Implications:**
  - The transfiguration prefigures the resurrection and the glorified state of Jesus, providing hope and assurance to the disciples.
  - It also emphasizes the necessity of Jesus’ sacrificial death, as later discussion with the disciples points to his suffering and resurrection.

##### Returning to Human Needs and Faith (Verses 14-21)

- **A Father's Plea and Disciples' Failure:**
  - Jesus returns to find the disciples unable to heal an epileptic boy. The father’s desperate plea emphasizes human suffering and need for divine intervention.
  
- **Jesus' Response:**
  - Jesus rebukes the faithlessness of the generation and heals the boy, stressing the power and necessity of faith.
  - His rebuke ("O faithless and perverse generation") and the miracle illustrate the importance of belief and the efficacy of divine power.

- **Faith as a Mustard Seed:**
  - Jesus teaches about the power of faith, comparing it to a tiny mustard seed that has the potential to move mountains, thus emphasizing the qualitative aspect of faith over quantity.
  - The note on "prayer and fasting" highlights the spiritual disciplines necessary to bolster faith and spiritual authority over demonic forces.

#### 2. "And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your teacher pay the half-shekel? ..."

##### Temple Tax and Divine Sonship (Verses 24-27)

- **Context:**
  - The temple tax was an obligatory payment for Jewish males. Jesus uses this occasion to teach about exemption and our duties.

- **Jesus and Peter’s Interaction:**
  - Jesus inquires about the custom of taxing outsiders versus sons, metaphorically positioning the disciples as “sons” free from the obligation.
  - However, to avoid causing offense, Jesus instructs Peter to find a coin in the mouth of a fish to pay the tax.

- **Key Themes:**
  - **Sonship and Freedom:** Jesus uses this situation to teach about the privilege of being God's children and the implications for the Kingdom of God.
  - **Humility and Compliance:** Despite their freedom, Jesus advocates for compliance to avoid unnecessary offense, modeling humility and discernment in engagement with societal obligations.

### Overall Significance

Matthew 17 captures the essence of Jesus as both divine and humble. The transfiguration spectacularly underscores his heavenly origin and future glory, while his interactions with the disciples and others — healing the epileptic boy and addressing the temple tax — ground his mission in everyday faith and humility. This duality is central to Christian theology, where Jesus’ divine authority and sacrificial servanthood provide a model for believers.

- **For Contemporary Readers:**
  - The chapter teaches the importance of faith, highlighting how even small, genuine faith can produce significant spiritual outcomes.
  - It calls for a balance of recognizing divine freedom and practicing humility in societal interactions.

Ultimately, Matthew 17 enriches our understanding of who Jesus is and how his followers are to live out their faith in both the divine and earthly realms.
