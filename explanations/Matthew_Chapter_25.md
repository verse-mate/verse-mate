### Introduction

Matthew Chapter 25 is part of the Olivet Discourse, where Jesus imparts crucial teachings about the kingdom of heaven and the end times to his disciples. Situated towards the end of Jesus’ ministry, these teachings emphasize readiness, stewardship, and the final judgment. Chapter 25 contains three prominent parables: the Parable of the Ten Virgins, the Parable of the Talents, and the account of the Sheep and the Goats. Each parable enriches the overall message about being vigilant, responsible, and compassionate as followers of Christ.
